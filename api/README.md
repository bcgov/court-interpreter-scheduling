Backend for Court Scheduling

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Installing

There are 2 options, run in `local` or `docker`.

#### Run in Local

In root folder:

- Start Keycloak and Database in docker first

```
docker-compose up keycloak
```

- Application

```
$ cp api/.config/.env.example api
$ cd api
$ npm i // first time
$ npm run start:dev
```

#### Run in Docker

```
docker-compose up
```

### Seeding

We use [typeorm-seeding](https://github.com/w3tecch/typeorm-seeding)

You can run seeding to get some testing data for development.

So far we seed the following data:

- `language`
- `interpreter`

```
$ npm run seed:run
```

`Seeding` files are located at `src/database/seeds`.

#### Issues

- https://github.com/w3tecch/typeorm-seeding/issues/29

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsconfig-paths

### Migration

- create migration file

```
$ npm run migrate:create <Migration File Name>
```

- running migration

1. Testing in local env,
   Set `syncronize: false, dropSchema: true` in `database.module.ts`.
   Then

```
$ npm run migrate:run
```

2. In Production env, will run migration automatically as we did set `migrationRun: process.env.NODE_ENV='prodcution'`
